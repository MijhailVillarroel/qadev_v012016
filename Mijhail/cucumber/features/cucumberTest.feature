Feature: Play Tabs
	As a music fan
    I would like to convert guitar tabs to music
    So that I can hear what they sound like

    This is the description of the feature, which can span multiple lines.
You can even include empty lines, like this one:

In fact, everything until the next Gherkin keyword is included in the description.
The text immediately following on the same line as the Feature keyword is the
name of the feature, and the remaining lines are its description.
